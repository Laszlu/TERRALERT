<h2>About</h2>
I wanted to build a project that could be useful for other people and could in theory be a real project requested by a customer.
This web-app shows currently occuring / recently occured natural disasters provided by the free <a href="https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/what-is-eonet" target="_blank">NASA EONET API</a> and 
uses the <a href="https://github.com/vasturiano/react-globe.gl/tree/master" target="_blank">react-globe repository by vasturiano</a> for visualization.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

The project required me to learn a new programming language/framework and from the available options I chose JavaScript + React.
For this choice my project should include a UI with controls for the user to manipulate the app.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- React + JavaScript 
- Web-Development Basics
- HTML + CSS 

<h2>Installation</h2>
